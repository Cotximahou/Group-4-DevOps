## Team Values

- **Collaboration** – Working cooperatively together as a team and supporting one another.  
- **Transparency** – Sharing information, progress, and any concerns openly.  
- **Respect** – Treating all team members amiably and valuing each other's perspectives.  
- **Accountability** – Taking responsibility for assigned tasks within the group project.

## Communication Guidelines

- **Primary Channel**: Microsoft Teams Group.  
- **Meeting Schedule**: DevOps Group 4 meetings take place twice a week (Tuesday & Thursday @ 17:00).  
- **Meeting Notes**: Notes taken during meetings will be written up and placed in the chat as a reference for anyone who couldn’t attend. Key agreements (like tasks) should also be placed in the chat to keep everyone in the loop. Using a Kanban Board is recommended for tracking everyone’s agreed tasks.  
- **Meeting Etiquette**: All members should be respectful and avoid interrupting others whenever possible.

## Attendance & Participation

- **Attendance**: Team members are encouraged to attend scheduled meetings whenever possible.  
- **Notice**: If a team member cannot attend, it is appreciated to notify the team via chat or communicate with someone in the team. Life happens, and short notice is understandable.  
- **Contributions**: Everyone is encouraged to contribute actively, including in discussions, tasks, or simply by being present.  
- **Workload**: Workload should be shared fairly to balance tasks and ensure everyone is involved in the project.

## Roles & Responsibilities

- Roles should be assigned as specified in Module / Unit 1.  
- Each member is responsible for completing assigned tasks on time and adhering to deadlines. If a member finishes their task early, they are encouraged to offer assistance to others via Teams chat.

## Conflict Resolution

- Address issues early and respectfully.  
- If conflict arises between members, individuals should attempt to resolve it themselves before escalating within the group.  
- Avoid shaming, finger-pointing, or aggressive behavior. Work together to resolve tension effectively.

- No plagiarism, AI misuse, or misrepresentation of work.
