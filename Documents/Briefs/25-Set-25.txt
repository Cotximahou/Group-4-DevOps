Key Points

Meetings & Planning

GitHub Project Kanban and Zube Kanban are linked and working.

Issues created in GitHub automatically appear on the Kanban board.

Next Tuesday: plan the steps to develop the application.

Project Structure & Development Approach

Project split into two main issues:

First part before the first code review.

Second part for the second module.

Each issue will be divided into sprints; sprint duration will depend on team progress and workload (to be decided).

Collaboration & Workflow

Each member works in their own repository/lab first to learn the concepts.

Later, work will be collaborative: members create personal branches and feature branches to implement tasks, which will then be merged into the main project repository.

Focus on learning collaborative coding, branching, and project management, not just individual coding.

Issues and user stories should be added with appropriate labels on the Kanban for tracking.

Tools & Setup

GitHub repository used for creating issues and managing user stories.

Zube Kanban board linked for automatic issue tracking.

Action Items

All members: Think about steps and user stories for the application development for next Tuesday.

Continue working on individual lab tasks while preparing for collaborative integration in the main repository.

Contact the group via Teams chat if you encounter issues with labs or need assistance.
